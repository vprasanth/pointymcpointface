# Module: ack_edge

Purpose: encapsulate Cloudflare resources needed for Ack host routing and edge wiring.

Planned resources (to be implemented later):
- DNS records for `ack.bleeping.dev` and `api.ack.bleeping.dev`
- Worker route attachments for Slack endpoints
- Pages domain attachment and related host config
- Ack-specific rules/policies at the edge

This module currently defines variable/output contracts only.
